Rumble is a mail server for SMTP(ESMTPA), POP3 and IMAP4rev1.
On top of the basic services, Rumble offers an extensive API for attaching modules in either
C/C++ or Lua to any aspect of mail handling, such as the included (default) 
white/grey/black-listing modules, mailing list module and load balancing module.

Domain and accounts can be managed through either SQLite3(default) or MySQL.

You can either configure and manage Rumble through the intuitive configuration files and databases,
or you can use the web interface module (RumbleLua) to configure any aspect of your server.
