Rumble is a mail server for SMTP, POP3 and IMAP with an Apache-like approach to its structure.
The server itself is quite small and - albeit ingenous and all that - rather basic.

This is however made up for by the modular approach to services, which enables users to easilly 
write their own plugins or simply use one or more of the existing plugins such as the 
white/grey/black-listing modules, mailing list module, load balancing and so on and so forth.

Obviously, you're not gonna download this piece of rubbish just yet, as it's far from done.
